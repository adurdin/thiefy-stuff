Make the 'Auto-search bodies' game option work in Thief 1 / Gold. A Squirrel
script that, when the auto-search bodies option is turned on, makes you take
an unconscious or dead body's belt and alt items when you frob their body,
just like in Thief 2.

The file sq_scripts/t1autosearchbodies.nut is all you need for this to work.

Please see sq_scripts/t1autosearchbodies.nut for instructions on using the script.
