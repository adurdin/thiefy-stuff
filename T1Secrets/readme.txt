'Secrets' stats for Thief 1 / Gold. A Squirrel script that allows secrets
like in Thief 2, but for Thief 1 / Gold.

The file sq_scripts/t1secrets.nut and a suitable debrief.str is all you
need for this to work. All the rest of these files are just for the
demo mission.

Please see sq_scripts/t1secrets.nut for instructions on using the script.
